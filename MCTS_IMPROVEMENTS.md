# MCTS Improvement Analysis

## Current Implementation Analysis

The current `MonteCarloTreeSearchPlayer` is actually implementing **flat Monte Carlo simulation** rather than true **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)**. This explains why it performs well but has room for significant improvement.

### Current Approach (Flat Monte Carlo)
- **Equal allocation**: Divides simulations equally among all available moves
- **No tree structure**: Each simulation is independent, no learning between simulations  
- **No UCB/UCT**: Simple win rate comparison without exploration bonus
- **No selection phase**: All moves get the same number of simulations

### Key Limitations
1. **No adaptive exploration**: Doesn't focus more simulations on promising moves
2. **No progressive deepening**: Each simulation starts from scratch
3. **Inefficient allocation**: Wastes simulations on obviously bad moves
4. **No tree reuse**: Cannot benefit from opponent moves or repeated positions

## Proposed Generic Improvements (No Game-Specific Heuristics)

### 1. True MCTS with UCT (Upper Confidence bound for Trees) ⭐ PRIORITY
- Implement proper tree structure with nodes
- Use UCB1 formula for selection: `win_rate + C * sqrt(ln(parent_visits) / node_visits)`
- Focus more simulations on promising branches
- **Expected impact**: 20-40% improvement in playing strength
- **Implementation complexity**: Medium

### 2. Progressive Widening
- Start with fewer children per node, expand as visits increase
- Formula: `max_children = floor(C * visits^alpha)` where alpha ≈ 0.5
- Reduces branching factor early in search
- **Expected impact**: 10-15% improvement by avoiding bad moves early
- **Implementation complexity**: Low

### 3. Tree Reuse Between Moves
- Keep tree in memory between moves
- Update root when opponent moves (if move exists in tree)
- Reset tree if opponent move not in current tree
- **Expected impact**: Effectively doubles simulation count over time
- **Implementation complexity**: Medium

### 4. Better Random Rollouts
- **Option A**: Heavy rollouts with simple heuristics (avoid immediate losses)
- **Option B**: RAVE (Rapid Action Value Estimation) - track move statistics across positions
- **Expected impact**: 15-25% improvement in simulation quality
- **Implementation complexity**: Medium (A) / High (B)

### 5. Root Parallelization
- Distribute simulations across multiple threads at root level
- Each thread runs independent simulations, results combined at root
- Simple to implement without race conditions
- **Expected impact**: Linear speedup with CPU cores
- **Implementation complexity**: Low-Medium

### 6. Advanced Selection Policies
- **Thompson Sampling**: Bayesian approach for move selection
- **Exp3**: Better for adversarial environments
- **UCB variants**: UCB1-Tuned, UCB-V, etc.
- **Expected impact**: 5-10% improvement
- **Implementation complexity**: Medium

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core MCTS Structure
1. Create `MCTSNode` class with:
   - Visit count, win count
   - Parent/children relationships
   - UCB1 calculation
2. Implement four MCTS phases:
   - **Selection**: Navigate tree using UCB1
   - **Expansion**: Add new child node
   - **Simulation**: Random rollout from new node
   - **Backpropagation**: Update statistics up the tree

### Phase 2: Optimizations
1. Add progressive widening
2. Implement tree reuse
3. Add root parallelization

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
1. Better rollout policies
2. RAVE implementation
3. Advanced selection policies

## Performance Baseline

Current tournament results show:
- **MCTS-1000**: 89.0% win rate
- **MCTS-500**: 77.0% win rate

Target with true MCTS implementation:
- **True MCTS-1000**: 95%+ win rate expected
- **True MCTS-500**: 85%+ win rate expected

## Technical Notes

### UCB1 Formula
```
UCB1 = (wins / visits) + C * sqrt(ln(parent_visits) / visits)
```
- **C parameter**: Exploration constant, typically √2 or tuned empirically
- **Balances**: Exploitation (high win rate) vs Exploration (low visit count)

### Tree Structure
```csharp
class MCTSNode
{
    int Visits { get; set; }
    int Wins { get; set; }
    MCTSNode? Parent { get; set; }
    List<MCTSNode> Children { get; set; }
    GameBoard GameState { get; set; }
    int LastMove { get; set; }
    bool IsFullyExpanded => Children.Count == AvailableMoves.Count;
}
```

### Progressive Widening
```csharp
int MaxChildren(int visits) => Math.Min(
    availableMoves.Length, 
    (int)Math.Floor(C * Math.Pow(visits, 0.5))
);
```

This analysis provides the foundation for implementing significant improvements to the MCTS algorithm while maintaining complete game-agnostic behavior.
